He has spent more than a decade working on "Comprehensive Cybersecurity Platform for the Digital-Era," which assists customers and partners in moving forward to the Digital-Era of Cybersecurity, where perimeters are fluid and cyberthreats are generated by vast clusters of machines that cannot be battled with people.

                <strong>Chandra S Pandey:</strong> I will talk about my Seceon journey because that is where I live and breathe every day. So, almost eight years ago, I was involved in another startup with an innovative team. We accomplished something that would typically take three to four years in just one year. We had a highly motivated team, but cyber security was a top concern for me, especially during my time at Juniper. It was evident that the industry was struggling, and we frequently witnessed major breaches occurring.
                Most of the time, organizations were unaware that they had been breached, whether it was Home Depot, JP Morgan, Target, or Sony. They often learned about these breaches from external sources. The challenge was not insufficient budget allocation for cyber security. In fact, they would sometimes spend hundreds of millions of dollars, yet they still faced issues with timely detection and response to these attacks, as they were often successful.
                Therefore, we decided to address this problem comprehensively and effectively. When I started this company, my goal was not merely to create an improved version of an existing product. From the beginning, our objective was to develop a platform that could proactively detect and automatically mitigate threats. Detecting threats alone was not sufficient because if you have to jump through hoops to stop something, chances are you have already lost critical information from your organization. That's why we embarked on this journey.
                When we initially launched the company, many people remarked that we were trying to do too much, like seven or eight companies in one. And they were absolutely right. To do things correctly, we needed to consider the context, situational awareness, and complete telemetry. Some telemetry was readily available from our digital footprint, while others had to be created. We understood the enormity of the task, accepted the challenge, and decided to be the ones to get started, even though it was not a path many would choose. That's how we began.
                After about a year of focused work, we successfully launched our platform. Our initial success came from the Managed Security Services Provider sector, which provided us with valuable insights to create an effective offering for small and medium businesses, as well as some large enterprises. That's how we got started.
